# KSOC Terraform Provider
This is the official Terraform Provider for KSOC. Use this provider to interact with the KSOC api.

To connect your AWS account to your KSOC account, create a `ksoc_aws_register` resource where you run terraform for your AWS resources. 

To configure the provider, you will need an access key and secret key that can be generated from the KSOC platform.
